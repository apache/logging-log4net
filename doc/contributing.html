						<li><b>Framework</b> - The .NET framework running the application, name (e.g. MS .NET, Mono, SSCLI) and version.</li>
						<li><b>Platform</b> - Computer operating system, version, and hardware platform in use.</li>
						<li><b>Configuration</b> - Attach configuration files if they would help track down the bug.</li>

						<li><b>Stack Traces</b> - Any stack traces generated by the bug, if any.</li>
						<li><b>Example</b> - Example configuration files or web applications which demonstrate the bug. When submitting an example which reproduces the bug, please try to make it as simple as possible.</li>

					Before starting to work on a patch it is probably a good idea to join the log4net-dev
					mailing list to check that equivalent or complementary work is not already underway.
				</p>
                                                <p>
					Currently the only supported way of submitting patches to log4net
					is via the JIRA issue tracking system.
				</p>
                                                <p>
					The preferred method of generating a patch is a unified context diff against
					the latest development version in SVN. To do this you should do the following:
				</p>
                                                <ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Get the latest version of the code from SVN, see the section above on 
							<i>Anonymous SVN Access</i> for details on how to obtain the SVN version. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Make your code changes to the log4net source. Please follow existing
							code styles where possible. If adding new API methods or classes then
							these should be appropriately documented with code comments.
							Contributions intended for inclusion in ASF products must be licensed 
							to ASF under the terms of the 
							<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache Software License</a>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Generate a unified context diff for the files you have changed. Run the
							<span class="code">svn diff &gt; patch-file</span> command from the root of the log4net
							codebase to generate a diff file. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							If you have added new files these will not be included in the diff. You
							will need to attach these files separately.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
                                                <p>
					If you are not using SVN then you can still generate a unified context diff
					using the <i>diff</i> GNU tool with the <i>-u</i> command line options. 
					The GNU tools are available for Windows as part
					of the <a href="www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> package.
				</p>

					In order to submit your patch please follow the following steps:
				</p>
                                                <ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Create a new issue for your patch. On the 
							<a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4NET">log4net issues home page</a>
							select the <i>Create New Issue</i> from the menu bar. You will need to be logged
							into JIRA in order to create an issue.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Select the issue type as appropriate.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Prefix the summary with <b>[PATCH]</b>. Enter a description of the changes made,
							new features, or bug fixes in your patch.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Once the issue has been created you can attach your patch file to the issue
							by selecting the <i>Attach file to this issue</i> operation from the left hand
							menu. When attaching your patch you must select the <b>Grant license to ASF for 
							inclusion in ASF works</b> option. When attaching a patch please include in the
							description the baseline version of log4net you used to build your patch, if against
							an SVN version please include the version number and if from a tag or branch include
							the repository path.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							If you have other files to attach, e.g. you have added new files to log4net, then
							attach each file separately. Please include in the description the name of the file
							attached and the path it should live in the project.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
                                                <p>
					A notification will be sent to the log4net-dev list once you have created your issue,
					however it may also be worth mailing the log4net-dev list to encourage the project
					committers to apply your patch, or at least find out when they may do so.
