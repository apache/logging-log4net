                <p>
                    Inserting log requests into the application code requires a fair amount of 
                    planning and effort. Observation shows that approximately 4 percent of code is 
                    dedicated to logging. Consequently, even moderately sized applications will 
                    have thousands of logging statements embedded within their code. Given their 
                    number, it becomes imperative to manage these log statements without the need 
                    to modify them manually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The log4net environment is fully configurable programmatically. However, it is 
                    far more flexible to configure log4net using configuration files. Currently, 
                    configuration files are written in XML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let us give a taste of how this is done with the help of an imaginary 
                    application
                    <span class="code">MyApp</span>
                    that uses log4net.
                </p>
                <div class="syntax"><pre class="code">
using Com.Foo;

// Import log4net classes.

public class MyApp 
{
    // Define a static logger variable so that it references the
    // Logger instance named "MyApp".
    <strong>private static readonly</strong> ILog log = <strong>LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(MyApp));</strong>

    static void Main(string[] args) 
    {
        // Set up a simple configuration that logs on the console.
        <strong>BasicConfigurator.Configure();</strong>

        log.Info("Entering application.");
        Bar bar = new Bar();
        bar.DoIt();
        log.Info("Exiting application.");
    }
}</pre></div>
                <p>
                    <span class="code">MyApp</span>
                    begins by importing log4net related classes. It then defines a static logger 
                    variable with the name
                    <span class="code">MyApp</span>
                    which happens to be the fully qualified name of the class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="code">MyApp</span>
                    uses the following
                    <span class="code">Bar</span>
                    class:
                </p>
                <div class="syntax"><pre class="code">
// Import log4net classes.
using log4net;

<b>namespace Com.Foo</b>
{
    public class Bar 
    {
        <strong>private static readonly</strong> ILog log = <strong>LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(Bar));</strong>

        public void DoIt()
        {
            log.Debug("Did it again!");
        }
    }
}</pre></div>
                <p>
                    The invocation of the
                    <span class="code">BasicConfigurator.Configure()</span>
                    method creates a rather simple log4net setup. This method is hardwired to add 
                    to the <i>root</i> logger a
                    <span class="code">ConsoleAppender</span>. The output will be formatted using a
                    <span class="code">PatternLayout</span>
                    set to the pattern
                    <span class="code">"%-4timestamp [%thread] %-5level %logger %ndc - %message%newline"</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that by default, the <i>root</i> logger is assigned to
                    <span class="code">Level.DEBUG</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The output of <span class="code">MyApp</span> is:
                </p>
                <source language="text"><![CDATA[
0    [main] INFO  MyApp  - Entering application.
36   [main] DEBUG Com.Foo.Bar  - Did it again!
51   [main] INFO  MyApp  - Exiting application.]]></source>
                <p>
                    As a side note, let me mention that in log4net child loggers link only to their 
                    existing ancestors. In particular, the logger named
                    <span class="code">Com.Foo.Bar</span>
                    is linked directly to the
                    <i>root</i>
                    logger, thereby circumventing the unused
                    <span class="code">Com</span>
                    or
                    <span class="code">Com.Foo</span>
                    loggers. This significantly increases performance and reduces log4net's memory 
                    footprint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The
                    <span class="code">MyApp</span>
                    class configures log4net by invoking
                    <span class="code">BasicConfigurator.Configure()</span>
                    method. Other classes only need to import the
                    <span class="code">log4net</span>
                    namespace, retrieve the loggers they wish to use, and log away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The previous example always outputs the same log information. Fortunately, it 
                    is easy to modify
                    <span class="code">MyApp</span>
                    so that the log output can be controlled at run-time. Here is a slightly 
                    modified version.
                </p>

                        Using attributes can be a clearer method for defining where the application's
                        configuration will be loaded from. However it is worth noting that attributes
                        are purely passive. They are information only. Therefore if you use configuration
                        attributes you must invoke log4net to allow it to read the attributes. A simple
                        call to <span class="code">LogManager.GetLogger</span> will cause the attributes
                        on the calling assembly to be read and processed. <strong>Therefore it is imperative
                        to make a logging call as early as possible during the application start-up, and
                        certainly before any external assemblies have been loaded and invoked.</strong>

                        Typically the log4net configuration is specified using a file. This file can
                        be read in one of two ways:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using the .NET <span class="code">System.Configuration</span> API</li>
                        <li>Reading the file contents directly</li>
                    </ul>

                        <p>    
                            The <span class="code">System.Configuration</span> API is only available if the
                            configuration data is in the application's config file; the file named 
                            <i>MyApp.exe.config</i> or <i>Web.config</i>. Because the <span class="code">System.Configuration</span> 
                            API does not support reloading of the config file the configuration settings 
                            cannot be watched using the <span class="code">log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator.ConfigureAndWatch</span> 
                            methods. The main advantage of using the <span class="code">System.Configuration</span>
                            APIs to read the configuration data is that it requires less permissions than accessing
                            the configuration file directly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The only way to configure an application using the <span class="code">System.Configuration</span>
                            APIs is to call the <span class="code">log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator.Configure()</span> method or
                            the <span class="code">log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator.Configure(ILoggerRepository)</span> method.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to embed the configuration data in the .config file the section name must be
                            identified to the .NET config file parser using a <span class="code">configSections</span> element.
                            The section must specify the <span class="code">log4net.Config.Log4NetConfigurationSectionHandler</span>
                            that will be used to parse the config section. This type must be fully assembly qualified
                            because it is being loaded by the .NET config file parser not by log4net. The correct
                            assembly name for the log4net assembly must be specified.
                            The following is a simple example configuration file that specifies the correct
                            section handler to use for the log4net section.

                            This assembly must be located where the .NET runtime can find it. For example it could
                            be located in the same directory as the application. If the log4net assembly is stored in
                            the GAC then the fully qualified assembly name must be specified including the culture,
                            version and public key.

                            The XmlConfigurator can directly read any XML file and use it to configure log4net. 
                            This includes the application's .config file; the file named <i>MyApp.exe.config</i> 
                            or <i>Web.config</i>. The only reason not to read the configuration file directly is if the
                            application does not have sufficient permissions to read the file, then the configuration
                            must be loaded using the .NET configuration APIs (see above).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The file to read the configuration from can be specified using any of
                            the <span class="code">log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator</span> methods that
                            accept a <span class="code">System.IO.FileInfo</span> object. Because the
                            file system can be monitored for file change notifications the 
                            <span class="code">ConfigureAndWatch</span> methods can be used to monitor
                            the configuration file for modifications and automatically reconfigure log4net.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally the <span class="code">log4net.Config.XmlConfiguratorAttribute</span>
                            can be used to specify the file to read the configuration from.

                        <p>
                            The configuration is read from the <span class="code">log4net</span> element
                            in the file. Only one <span class="code">log4net</span> element can be specified
                            in the file but it may be located anywhere in the XML hierarchy. For example it
                            may be the root element:

                            The above example shows how the configuration data can be embedded

                            by log4net. An important note is that the .NET config file parser
                            will throw an exception if it finds an element that has not been
                            registered using the <span class="code">configSections</span> element.
                            Therefore in the above example the <span class="code">log4net</span>
                            section name is registered, but the type specified to handle the
                            section is <span class="code">System.Configuration.IgnoreSectionHandler</span>.
                            This is a built-in class that indicates that another method for reading
                            the config section will be employed.

                                Filters form a chain that the event has to pass through. Any filter along the way can accept the event 
                                and stop processing, deny the event and stop processing, or allow the event on to the next filter. 
                                If the event gets to the end of the filter chain without being denied it is implicitly accepted and will be logged.
                            </p>
                            <source language="xml"><![CDATA[

                            <p>
                                This filter will deny events that have a level that is lower than <span class="code">INFO</span>
                                or higher than <span class="code">FATAL</span>. 
                                All events between <span class="code">INFO</span> and <span class="code">FATAL</span> will be logged.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If we want to only allow messages through that have a specific substring (e.g. 'database') 
                                then we need to specify the following filters:
                            </p>
                            <source language="xml"><![CDATA[
<filter type="log4net.Filter.StringMatchFilter">
    <stringToMatch value="database" />
</filter>
<filter type="log4net.Filter.DenyAllFilter" />]]></source>
                            <p>
                                The first filter will look for the substring 'database' in the message text of the event. 
                                If the text is found the filter will accept the message and filter processing will stop, 
                                the message will be logged. If the substring is not found the event will be passed to 
                                the next filter to process. If there is no next filter the event would be implicitly 
                                accepted and would be logged. But because we don't want the non matching events to be 
                                logged we need to use a <span class="code">log4net.Filter.DenyAllFilter</span>
                                that will just deny all events that reach it. This filter is only useful at the end of the filter chain.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If we want to allow events that have either 'database' or 'ldap' in the message text we can use the following filters:
                            </p>
