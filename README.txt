Project Status
==============

Apache Log4net was voted to dormant status on April 1, 2020. Dormant status
indicates that the project is not being actively maintained, that no future
releases are planned and, most likely, there are few or no developers left
in the Apache Logging project familiar with this code base. 

If you wish to use any of this library you must build it yourself and should
assume that no future releases will be forthcoming.

Update
======

This fork simply updates to netstandard2. In doing so, a couple appenders 
were removed as I don't care about them and the upgrade was non trivial. Ideally,
the appenders would be separate packages, but I'm not going there.
