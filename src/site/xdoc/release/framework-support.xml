        <p>
            log4net is built on a number of different frameworks. Each new version of the frameworks add
            new features. To take advantage of these new features we must build log4net using the
            appropriate framework. We also maintain builds compatible with older versions of the frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to remember that the .NET frameworks support backward compatibility, that is
            a new version of the framework will run binary assemblies that were targeted to previous versions
            of the framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            log4net is regularly built by its developers on the following frameworks:
