        <p>
          Plugins are additional modular components that are attached to a logger repository.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plugins are stored in the <span class="code">PluginMap</span> of an
          <span class="code">ILoggerRepository</span>.
          Plugins are attached to the repository by using the <span class="code">PluginMap.Add</span>
          method.
        </p>

        <section id="attributes" name="Plugin Attributes">
          <p>
            Plugins can be configured using the following assembly-level attributes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>PluginAttribute</h3>
              <p>
                Specifies a plugin type to create and attach to the default repository. This attribute
                does not allow plugins to be parameterized. The plugin class must have a public default constructor.
              </p>
              <p>
                This attribute may be used as many times as necessary to attach plugins to the repository.
              </p>
