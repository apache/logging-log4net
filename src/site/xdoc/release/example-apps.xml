                        A single example can be build by running <span class="code">nant</span> from
                        the example directory.

                    <p>
                        For example running <span class="code">nant</span> in the 
                        <span class="code">examples\net\1.0\Tutorials\ConsoleApp\cs</span> directory
                        will build the C# version of the .NET 1.0 ConsoleApp example.

                    <p>
                        <span class="code">nant</span> can be run in any directory containing a
                        <span class="code">nant.build</span> file. The typical behavior of the build file
                        is to build all projects under the current directory.

                        this virtual directory as an application. Open up a web browser, navigate to
                        the virtual directory and to the <span class="code">WebForm1.aspx</span> page within it.
