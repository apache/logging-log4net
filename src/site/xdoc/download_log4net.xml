  <section name="Verify Releases">

    <p>It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded
    files using the PGP signature or MD5 checksums.  The checksums are
    not as strong indicators as the PGP signature.</p>

    <p>Please read <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/dev/verification.html">Verifying
    Apache HTTP Server Releases</a> for more information on why you
    should verify our releases.  The PGP keys used to sign our
    distributions are part of the <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/dist/logging/log4net/KEYS">KEYS
    file</a>.</p>
