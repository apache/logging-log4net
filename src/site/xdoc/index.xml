      <p>
        The Apache log4net library is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety 
        of output targets. log4net is a port of the excellent Apache log4j&#x2122; framework to the 
        Microsoft&#xae; .NET runtime. We have kept the framework similar in spirit to the original log4j 
        while taking advantage of new features in the .NET runtime.
        For more information on log4net see the <a href="release/features.html">features</a> document.
