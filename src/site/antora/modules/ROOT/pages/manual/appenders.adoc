[#appenders]
= Appenders

Appenders are responsible for delivering log events to their destination.
Every Appender must implement the `IAppender` interface.

While not strictly required by the log4net architecture, most appenders inherit from `AppenderSkeleton` and:

* delegate the filtering of log events to an implementation of `IFilter`.
See xref:manual/filters.adoc[] for more information.
* delegate the formatting of log events to an implementation of `ILayout`.
See xref:manual/layouts.adoc[] for more information.
* only directly handle the writing of log event data to the target destination.

Appenders always have a name so that they can be referenced from a
xref:manual/configuration.adoc#configuring-loggers[logger configuration].

[#appenders-list]
== List of appenders

log4net ships with the following appenders
[cols="Type,Description"]

|AdoNetAppender
|Writes logging events to a database using either prepared statements or stored procedures.

|AnsiColorTerminalAppender

|BufferingForwardingAppender
|Buffers events and then forwards them to attached appenders.

|ColoredConsoleAppender
|Writes color highlighted logging events to the application's Windows Console.

|ConsoleAppender
|Writes logging events to the application's Console.
The events may go to either the standard our stream or the standard error stream.

|DebugAppender
|Writes logging events to the .net debugger (https://web.archive.org/web/20240930165834/https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.debug?view=net-8.0[System.Diagnostics.Debug]).

|EventLogAppender
|Writes logging events to the Windows Event Log.

|FileAppender
|Writes logging events to a file in the file system.

|LocalSyslogAppender
|Writes logging events to the local https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3164[syslog] service (UNIX only).

|MemoryAppender
|Stores logging events in an in memory buffer.

|OutputDebugStringAppender
|Writes logging events to the debugger (using https://web.archive.org/web/20241118170546/https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/debugapi/nf-debugapi-outputdebugstringw[OutputDebugString]).
If the application has no debugger, the system debugger displays the string.
If the application has no debugger and the system debugger is not active, the message is ignored.

|RemoteSyslogAppender
|Writes logging events to a remote https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3164[syslog] service using UDP networking.

|RollingFileAppender
|Writes logging events to a file in the file system.
The RollingFileAppender can be configured to log to multiple files based upon date or file size constraints.

|SmtpAppender
|Sends logging events to an email address.

|SmtpPickupDirAppender
|Sends logging events to an email address but writes the emails to a configurable directory rather than sending them directly via SMTP.

|TelnetAppender
|*Clients* connect via Telnet to receive logging events.

|TraceAppender
|Writes logging events to the .NET trace system (https://web.archive.org/web/20240907024634/https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.trace?view=net-8.0[System.Diagnostics.Trace]).

|UdpAppender
|Sends logging events as connectionless UDP datagrams to a remote host or a multicast group using a UdpClient.

|ForwardingAppender
|Can be used to wrap another appender, for example to attach additional filters.
