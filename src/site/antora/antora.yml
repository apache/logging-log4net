#  The actual `antora.yml` that is used in `target/generated-site/antora` is auto-generated from `antora.tmpl.yml`.
#  Auto-generation happens during `pre-site` phase of Maven.
#  Hence, you must always
#
#  1. Edit `antora.tmpl.yml`
#  2. Edit `antora.yml` to match the fields in `antora.tmpl.yml` and fill Maven property placeholders with dummy values
