#  THIS FILE IS USED AS A TEMPLATE TO AUTO-GENERATE `antora.yml`!
#
#  The actual `antora.yml` that is used in `target/generated-site/antora` is auto-generated from `.antora.yml`.
#  Auto-generation happens during `pre-site` phase of Maven.
#  Hence, you must always
#
#  1. Edit `.antora.yml`
#  2. Edit `antora.yml` to match the fields in `.antora.yml` and fill Maven property placeholders with dummy values
