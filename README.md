Developing
==========

log4net targets a wide array of .net platforms, including some
which are out of support from Microsoft, making it difficult to
install relevant SDKs and build for those targets. In particular,
older Client Profile .NET Framework targets and dotnet core 1.1
may be installed by using the bundled helper scripts:

- [install-net-framework-sdk-3.5.ps1]()
- [install-dotnet-core-sdk-1.1.ps1]()

These scripts download the relevant installers from Microsoft servers,
but you run them at your own risk.
