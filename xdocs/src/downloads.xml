				<p>
					log4net is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software 
					Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Logging Services project. 
					Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further 
					review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision 
					making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other 
					successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a 
					reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does 
					indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
				</p>
				<p>
					As log4net is undergoing incubation these releases are <i>not</i>
					officially endorsed by the ASF.
