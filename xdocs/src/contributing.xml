						First login to the CVS server as the anonymous user.
					</p>
					
					<source language="shell">
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic login
password: anoncvs</source>

			<section name="Issue Tracking">
				<p>
					Many bugs reported end up not being a bug in the log4net code, 
					but are due to incorrect configuration, problems caused by installed applications, 
					the operating system, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before reporting a bug please make every effort to investigate and resolve the problem yourself. 
					Just reporting a bug will not fix it. A good bug report includes a detailed 
					description of the problem and a succinct test case which can reproduce the problem. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Before reporting an issue please investigate the following information sources for
					a potential resolution.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="release/manual/introduction.html">Documentation</a></li>
					<li><a href="release/faq.html#internalDebug">Internal log4net debug</a></li>
					<li><a href="release/faq.html">FAQs</a></li>
					<li><a href="support.html">Mailing Lists</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Before reporting a bug, you are advised to discuss it on the relevant mailing list first.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4NET">Search the bug database</a> to see if the bug 
					you are seeing has already been reported. If it has been reported then you can vote for the issue.
				</p>
				
				<section name="Reporting an Issue">
					<p>
						If after you have exhausted all other resources to resolve a problem you may want to file a bug report.
						Please make sure the problem is a bug in Logging and not a bug in your application.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please make sure you provide as much information as possible. Its very hard to fix a bug if the person 
						looking into the problem can't reproduce it. Here is a listing of information which should be included:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Version</b> - log4net version, or if from a nightly build, version and date of build.</li>
						<li><b>Application Type</b> - Assembly type, i.e. exe or dll, and how your code is launched, e.g. console application, windows application, ASP.NET project, COM+ hosted object, etc...</li>
						<li><b>Framework</b> - The .NET framework running the application, name (e.g. MS .NET, Mono, SSCLI) and version.</li>
						<li><b>Platform</b> - Computer operating system, version, and hardware platform in use.</li>
						<li><b>Configuration</b> - Attach configuration files if they would help track down the bug.</li>
						<li><b>Log Files</b> - Review your logs files, produced with <a href="release/faq.html#internalDebug">internal log4net debug</a> enabled. Submit any relevant sections of the log which help document the bug.</li>
						<li><b>Stack Traces</b> - Any stack traces generated by the bug, if any.</li>
						<li><b>Example</b> - Example configuration files or web applications which demonstrate the bug. When submitting an example which reproduces the bug, please try to make it as simple as possible.</li>
						<li><b>Bug Fix Patch</b> - A patch created using <span class="code">diff -u</span> which fixes the bug. (If you have found a bug fix which can be applied to the code).</li>
						<li><b>Description of the Bug</b> - A description of the bug, include observed as well as expected behaviour.</li>
						<li><b>Miscellaneous</b> - Any other information you feel will help track down the problem.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<b>Just reporting a bug will not fix it. A good bug report includes a detailed description of the 
						problem and a succinct test case which can reproduce the problem.</b>
